# Problem Set 7
Project Name: Problem Set 7

Files included ProblemSet7.1.c, ProblemSet7.2.c, sine.dat, sine.wav

Our study group did not meet this week, so I completed these problems alone.

Both of these problems took me a long time to figure only because I did not understand the syntax of the functions I was to use. For instance, I did not understand how to correctly use popen even though it ended up being much more simple than I initially thought. This seems to be a themeâ€” once the answer is revealed, it seems extremely obvious to me, but reaching that point is sometimes painstaking in comparison to how simple I feel it should have been. In fact, both of these problems had such similar answers that I'm suspecting I may have missed something.
